## Overview

This library is designed to generate visualizations of neural networks by analyzing PyTorch code. Unlike conventional methods, our approach eliminates the need for large parameter files (pth) or specific input formats. With minimal AI knowledge, users can leverage this tool to create visualizations that aid in understanding complex networks, including support for transformers and attention mechanisms.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python and PyTorch installed. Install the library using the following command:

<!-- ```bash
pip install your-library
``` -->

## Usage

To generate visualizations, simply provide PyTorch code as input. The library will analyze the code and create visual representations of the neural network. No need for large parameter files or intricate input formats.

```python
import numpy as np
import nnanim.analyzer
from TestingCode import vit
from TestingCode import modules

la = nnanim.analyzer.ModuleAnalyzer()
la.start_analyze_module(modules.Attention(dim=2*768))
```

For the example `TestingCode`, we are using a code base of vit: https://github.com/gupta-abhay/pytorch-vit/tree/main.
